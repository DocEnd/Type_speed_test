               'Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing, That heavy Saturn laughed and leaped with him.' \
               'Yet nor the lays of birds, nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and in hue ' \
               'Could make me any summer"s story tell, Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew.' \
               'Nor did I wonder at the lily"s white, Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;' \
               'They were but sweet, but figures of delight Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.' \
               'Yet seemed it winter still, and you away, As with your shadow I with these did play.'

    # 'California is known all over the world for its size, its sun, and its surf, its glamour and its ' \
    #            'optimism. But it is known too as "Earthquake Country " â€” a truly vulnerable region where big ' \
    #            'devastating quakes have occurred in the past and could happen again. It is unlikely that a ' \
    #            'disaster on the scale of recent disasters in Italy or Japan could occur in California; ' \
    #            'California has learnt from its past disasters, and most buildings are designed to withstand major ' \
    #            'quakes. Nevertheless, Californians are worried. When will the next big quake strike the state, and ' \
    #            'where will all the shaking and crumbling and rocking begin?' \
    #            'Nobody knows for sure, but at all times California is on the alert. The could be an earthquake ' \
    #            'in California today. Consequently the earth is permanently monitored with high-tech seismographs ' \
    #            'situated in universities and government research stations; they are constantly watched by ' \
    #            'highly-trained employees and volunteers from the California Office of Emergency Services; ' \
    #            'and students in every school receive training in what to do in the event of* an earthquake. ' \
    #            'Working at Menlo Park, near Stanford University, in the middle of "Earthquake Country", scientists ' \
    #            'from the United States Geological Survey are always monitoring and studying fault systems, and ' \
    #            'trying to predict where earthquakes are going to take place next. Back in 1988, a team of USGS ' \
    #            'scientists completed a ten-year survey on "earthquake possibilities", and came up with the ' \
    #            'conclusion that there going to be a lot of shaking in the years ahead. In particular, ' \
    #            'they predicted a 50% possibility of an exceptionally big quake of 8.3 sometime before 2018, ' \
    #            'somewhere along the San Andreas or Hayward faults. In the two centuries from 1812 to 2012 , ' \
    #            'California has suffered dozens of earthquakes. The last seriously damaging earthquake was the ' \
    #            '1994 quake in the Los Angeles area, that registered 6.7 on the Richter scale, and did up to ' \
    #            '$40 billion worth of damage. A much stronger quake, of 7.2 on the Richter scale, struck Baja ' \
    #            'California (Mexico) in 2010, doing over a billion dollars worth of damage in this far less ' \
    #            'populated area.'
